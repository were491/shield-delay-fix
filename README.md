# shield-delay-fix
this should remove the delay between right clicking and having your shield work I JUST WANT TO HAVE WORKING SHIELDS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

* Also keep in mind this won't compensate for a bad connection if you play on a server. Your ping also can create a "shield delay" of its own and cause you to get hit while blocking.

so yeah anyways the first version is for 1.16 technically but requires java 16 because i have NO IDEA how to change the template to work with java 8 I TRIED IT AND IT KEPT GIVING MY ERRORS TELLING ME TO USE A NEW JAVA so yeah i gave up whatever if you delete javacheck from your launcher folder it works so yeah
